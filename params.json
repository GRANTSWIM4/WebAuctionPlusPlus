{"tagline":"A redesigned interface for WebAuction+.","body":"This is a redesigned interface for WebAuction+. WebAuction+ is based off of WebAuction.\r\n# Disclaimer\r\nI did not make WebAuction+, and all JAR files should be downloaded from that project. These are the web server files. I would have done much more had it used the later version of jQuery. It blocked all my Javascript :(, expect more web updates later!\r\n\r\n# About\r\nWebAuction+ has a cluttered interface, so we've made some UX changes to make it look pretty. As always, fork us and submit pull requests!\r\n\r\n\r\n# Support\r\nAll problems should be filed under an issue under GitHub. Anything else should be directed to the WebAuction+ team.\r\n\r\n","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","name":"WebAuction++","google":""}
