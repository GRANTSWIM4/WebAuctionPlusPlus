It's used internally to help with page regeneration.","body":"This is a redesigned interface for WebAuction+. WebAuction+ is based off of WebAuction.\r\n\r\n# Install\r\n1. First, download the [latest web files](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/webauctionplusplus/files/) and the [latest JAR file](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/webauctionplus/files/12-web-auction-plus-1-1-7/).\r\n2. Next, create a MySQL database and user. Do not forget what you put in!\r\n3. Drop the JAR file from the second file you downloaded into your plugins folder and reload the server. You can now delete that file.\r\n4. Next, add the MySQL username and password to the configuration file the plugin generated. \r\n5. Now, open up the first file you downloaded. Edit the config.php with your MySQL details.\r\n6. You should now upload the files to your web server. Reload your Minecraft server again.\r\n7. Yay! You should now do `/wa password [password]` to set your password, and then log in online!\r\n8. You should now read WebAuction+'s [documentation to set it up!](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/webauctionplus/pages/installing-and-updating/)\r\n\r\n# About\r\nWebAuction+ has a cluttered interface, so we've made some UX changes to make it look pretty. As always, fork us and submit pull requests!\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\nI did not make WebAuction+, and all JAR files should be downloaded from that project. These are the web server files. I would have done much more had it used the later version of jQuery. It blocked all my Javascript :(, expect more web updates later!\r\n\r\n# Support\r\nAll problems should be filed under an issue under GitHub. Anything else should be directed to the WebAuction+ team.","name":"WebAuction++"}
