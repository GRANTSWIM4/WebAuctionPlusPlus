First, download the [latest web files](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/webauctionplusplus/files/) and the [latest JAR file](http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/webauctionplus/files/12-web-auction-plus-1-1-7/).\r\n2. Next, create a MySQL database and user. \r\n\r\n# About\r\nWebAuction+ has a cluttered interface, so we've made some UX changes to make it look pretty. As always, fork us and submit pull requests!\r\n\r\n# Disclaimer\r\nI did not make WebAuction+, and all JAR files should be downloaded from that project. These are the web server files. I would have done much more had it used the later version of jQuery. It blocked all my Javascript :(, expect more web updates later!\r\n\r\n# Support\r\nAll problems should be filed under an issue under GitHub. Anything else should be directed to the WebAuction+ team.","name":"WebAuction++"}
