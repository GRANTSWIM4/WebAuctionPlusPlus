==Web Auction PlusPlus==
Hey there! This is my first BukkitDev "post". I have redesigned the web interface for WebAuctionPlus, and am posting the custom files here.
==Disclaimer==
I did not make WebAuction+, and all JAR files should be downloaded from that project. These are the web server files. I would have done much more had it used the later version of jQuery. It blocked all my Javascript :(, expect more web updates later!
==About==
WebAuction+ includes an OK web interface, but OK is not OK. I've built a new interface that shines using BootStrap, that can be easily updated with new features. 

==Support==
Comments are great for help with the web part, but direct all plugin questions to the WebAuction+.

Also, happy new year!
