        <p>This is a redesigned interface for WebAuction+. WebAuction+ is based off of WebAuction.</p>

<h1>Install</h1>

<ol>
<li>First, download the <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/webauctionplusplus/files/">latest web files</a> and the <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/webauctionplus/files/12-web-auction-plus-1-1-7/">latest JAR file</a>.</li>
<li>Next, create a MySQL database and user. Do not forget what you put in!</li>
<li>Drop the JAR file from the second file you downloaded into your plugins folder and reload the server. You can now delete that file.</li>
<li>Next, add the MySQL username and password to the configuration file the plugin generated. </li>
<li>Now, open up the first file you downloaded. Edit the config.php with your MySQL details.</li>
<li>You should now upload the files to your web server. Reload your Minecraft server again.</li>
<li>Yay! You should now do <code>/wa password [password]</code> to set your password, and then log in online!</li>
<li>You should now read WebAuction+'s <a href="http://dev.bukkit.org/server-mods/webauctionplus/pages/installing-and-updating/">documentation to set it up!</a>
</li>
</ol><h1>About</h1>

<p>WebAuction+ has a cluttered interface, so we've made some UX changes to make it look pretty. As always, fork us and submit pull requests!</p>

<h1>Disclaimer</h1>

<p>I did not make WebAuction+, and all JAR files should be downloaded from that project. These are the web server files. I would have done much more had it used the later version of jQuery. It blocked all my Javascript :(, expect more web updates later!</p>

<h1>Support</h1>

<p>All problems should be filed under an issue under GitHub. Anything else should be directed to the WebAuction+ team.</p>
